This repository contains the evaluation model trained for image-based scene. The models can be downloaded from the following [link](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jwu220_jh_edu/EvRERqH7tU5AjdlUcXDzobcBVA7vr6gwtpPQv8s_7R_oYQ?e=3Ji9Ej), and are classified based on the camera view and the type of visual encoder.

Additionally, it includes the dataset used for the imitation learning experiments. Each subtask in our image-based dataset consists of 50 demonstrations, resulting in the following number of transitions:
- **Approach:** 4,696 
- **Place:** 6,792
- **Handoff:** 5,791
- **Pullout:** 4,156
